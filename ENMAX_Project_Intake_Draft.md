---

### Draft Message:

Dear ENMAX Project Intake Team,

I am writing on behalf of the condominium corporation at **3412 Parkdale Blvd. N.W., Calgary, AB T2N 3T4** to request a project intake consultation regarding electrical infrastructure requirements for installing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

**Project Overview:**
We are a 28-unit, 4-storey condominium building constructed in 1999, currently applying for the City of Calgary's ChargeYYC Phase 2 Multi-Residential Pilot Program. We are preparing to install EV charging infrastructure in our underground parkade and need to understand what electrical service upgrades may be required.

**Current Building Information:**
- **Property Address:** 3412 Parkdale Blvd. N.W., Calgary, AB T2N 3T4
- **Building Type:** 4-storey wood frame condominium (28 residential units)
- **Construction Year:** 1999
- **Electrical Configuration:** Individual meters for each unit (heating, hot water, and electrical)
- **Parking:** 40 stalls in single-level heated underground parkade

**Proposed Scope:**
- Installation of Level 2 (208V/240V) EV charging stations
- Number of charging stations: [To be determined based on final design - initially planning for approximately 10-15 stations]
- EV Energy Management System (EVEMS) to manage electrical loads
- Potential Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) bidirectional charging capability where supported by equipment and regulations
- Individual unit connection where applicable (leveraging existing individual metering)

**Load Assessment Needs:**
We need to determine:
1. Whether our current electrical service has adequate capacity to support EV charging infrastructure
2. What infrastructure upgrades in the area may be required to support the increased load
3. The scope of construction required to complete the proposed upgrade
4. Timeline and coordination requirements

**ChargeYYC Program Context:**
Please note that we are determining our ability to make building upgrades for electric vehicle charging through **The City of Calgary's ChargeYYC Multi-Residential Pilot Program**. This is a city-supported initiative to enable EV infrastructure in multi-residential buildings.

**Next Steps Requested:**
We would appreciate:
- Guidance on the information/documentation you need from us for the load assessment
- An initial assessment of our current service capacity
- Information on potential timeline for any required infrastructure upgrades
- Details on the project intake process and next steps

**Project Timeline:**
- ChargeYYC application deadline: November 18, 2025
- Expected selection notification: January 2026
- Installation completion: Within 9 months of funding approval (if selected)

We have completed a Phase 1 EV Charging Road Map through the ChargeYYC program and have contractor estimates in hand. We are prepared to provide any technical documentation required for your assessment.

**Contact Information:**
- **Primary Contact:** David Nelson Elske
- **Title:** Treasurer, Condominium Board
- **Email:** david.nelson.elske@gmail.com
- **Phone:** 403-650-5365
- **Property Address:** 3412 Parkdale Blvd. N.W., Calgary, AB T2N 3T4

Thank you for your assistance with this important infrastructure upgrade. We look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps in the project intake process.

Sincerely,

David Nelson Elske
Treasurer

## Information to Gather Before Sending (if available):

- [ ] Current electrical service size (amps) - check with property manager or electrical panel
- [ ] ENMAX account number(s) for the property
- [ ] Copy of recent electrical bill or service agreement
- [ ] Electrical panel location and configuration details
- [ ] Any previous electrical upgrades or assessments

## After ENMAX Response:

Once ENMAX responds, update the CLAUDE.md Supporting Documentation section:

**Current placeholder:**
```
5. ENMAX Project Intake correspondence (to be submitted)
```

**Update to:**
```
5. ENMAX Project Intake correspondence:
   - Initial inquiry submitted: [DATE]
   - ENMAX response received: [DATE]
   - Key findings: [Summary of capacity assessment and upgrade requirements]
   - Estimated timeline for infrastructure upgrades: [If applicable]
   - Project reference number: [If provided]
```

## What to Include in ChargeYYC Application

If ENMAX has responded before you submit ChargeYYC application:

### Option A: ENMAX Confirmed Adequate Capacity
"ENMAX Project Intake assessment confirms that our current electrical service has adequate capacity to support the proposed EV charging infrastructure with the implementation of an EV Energy Management System (EVEMS). No utility-side infrastructure upgrades are required. [Include ENMAX reference number if provided]"

### Option B: ENMAX Indicated Upgrades Required
"ENMAX Project Intake assessment indicates that infrastructure upgrades in the area will be required to support the increased load from EV charging. ENMAX has provided a preliminary scope and timeline of [X months] for completion of utility-side upgrades. This project intake demonstrates proactive coordination with utility providers and realistic implementation planning. [Include ENMAX reference number if provided]"

### Option C: ENMAX Assessment Pending (Most Likely for November 18 Application)
"We have initiated contact with ENMAX Project Intake Team to assess electrical service capacity and determine any required infrastructure upgrades. This proactive engagement demonstrates our commitment to thorough planning and coordination with utility providers. We will provide ENMAX assessment results upon completion and incorporate findings into the final engineering site design phase."

## Notes:

- **Webform location:** The ChargeYYC application guide mentions contacting ENMAX via their webform or email - use whichever is most current on ENMAX website
- **Timing:** Send this ASAP - ENMAX may take several weeks to respond
- **Documentation:** Save all ENMAX correspondence for ChargeYYC application
- **Follow-up:** If no response within 2 weeks, follow up with phone call

## Additional Context for ENMAX (Optional - Add if Helpful):

**Why Individual Metering Matters:**
"Our building's existing individual electrical metering for each unit creates an opportunity for innovative EV charging design, where individual residents can pay for their own charging costs through their existing electrical accounts, similar to how they currently pay for their unit's heating and electrical usage."

**V2B Capability:**
"We are exploring Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) bidirectional charging capability as part of this project to enhance building energy resilience and support grid stability. We would appreciate any guidance ENMAX can provide regarding requirements or considerations for bidirectional charging in multi-residential settings."
