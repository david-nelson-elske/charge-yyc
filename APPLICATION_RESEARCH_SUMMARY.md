# ChargeYYC Phase 2 Application - Research Summary

## Key Research Findings

### Your Building's Strategic Position

Your 4-storey wood frame building constructed in 1999 is **highly representative** of a large segment of Calgary's multi-residential housing stock. Here's why this matters for your application:

## 1. Building Archetype Significance

### The 4-Storey Standard (1990s)
- **Building code maximum:** In the 1990s, Calgary's building code limited wood frame construction to a maximum of 4 storeys
- **Code change timeline:** It wasn't until November 2014 that Calgary became the first Canadian city to accept permits for 5-6 storey wood frame buildings
- **Your building's positioning:** As a 4-storey wood frame building from 1999, your property represents the **maximum height and most common archetype** from that construction era

### Size of the Opportunity
- **1990s construction boom:** Approximately 75,000-80,000 structures were built in Calgary during the 1990s
- **Similar cohort:** The 1990s saw similar growth to the 1970s, creating two large decades of buildings that now need EV infrastructure retrofits
- **Replicable template:** Success at your building provides a roadmap for potentially **thousands of similar 4-storey wood frame buildings** across Calgary

## 2. Individual Metering - A Key Advantage

### Why This Matters for EV Charging
Your building has individual electrical meters for each unit, which is a significant advantage:

**Energy Conservation Benefits:**
- Individually metered residences consume 17% less energy on average
- Studies show submetering can reduce building energy consumption by 18-40%
- Residents are more conscious of electricity use when they pay for their own consumption

**EV Charging Benefits:**
- **Fair cost allocation:** EV owners pay for their own charging electricity
- **Easier approval:** Removes the barrier of non-EV owners subsidizing EV charging
- **Resident buy-in:** Clear accountability makes it easier to get condo board/resident approval
- **Future-proof:** As more residents adopt EVs, individual metering prevents conflicts over shared costs

**Alberta Context:**
- Alberta requires suite metering for all new construction and renovations
- Ratio Utility Billing (RUBs) of electricity is not allowed
- Your building's 1999 construction already has this forward-thinking infrastructure

## 3. Strategic Framing for Your Application

### Position Your Building as a Pilot Program Template

The ChargeYYC program wants to "learn from the experiences of Calgarians participating in this program to help inform City policies." Your building is **ideal** for this because:

1. **Highly Representative**
   - Common construction type (wood frame, 4 storeys)
   - Common construction era (1990s boom)
   - Typical aging infrastructure (25 years old)

2. **Replicable Learnings**
   - Solutions you develop will apply to thousands of similar buildings
   - Electrical challenges you face will be common across the 1990s cohort
   - Installation methods can be standardized for this building type

3. **Diverse Selection Criteria**
   - Building archetype ✓ (standard 4-storey wood frame)
   - Building age ✓ (1990s construction)
   - Building location ✓ (Parkdale - inner city intensification area)
   - Installation considerations ✓ (typical for era)

## 4. Parkdale Neighbourhood Context

### Community Evolution
- **Original development:** Post-WWII (1948+), primarily single-family bungalows
- **Current mix:** 50.3% single/semi-detached, 49.7% row houses/condos/apartments (2006 data)
- **Your building's role:** Part of the neighbourhood's evolution toward multi-residential density
- **Inner-city intensification:** Represents Calgary's urban development pattern

### Geographic Diversity
- Inner-city established neighbourhood (vs. new suburban developments)
- Provides case study for retrofitting older neighbourhoods
- Different infrastructure challenges than new communities

## 5. Recommended Narrative Strategy

### Frame Your Application Around These Themes:

**1. Scalability**
"Our building represents thousands of similar 4-storey wood frame buildings constructed during Calgary's 1990s growth. Success here creates a template for widespread EV infrastructure adoption."

**2. Existing Advantages**
"Individual electrical metering for each unit eliminates a common barrier to EV charging approval in multi-residential buildings - fair cost allocation is already built into our infrastructure."

**3. Aging Infrastructure Retrofit**
"At 25 years old, our building demonstrates how Calgary's existing housing stock can be upgraded for the next generation of transportation, supporting the city's climate goals."

**4. Representative Challenges**
"The electrical infrastructure challenges we address will be common across the substantial 1990s-era housing stock, making our learnings directly applicable to similar properties."

**5. Climate Impact at Scale**
"By creating a replicable model for 1990s 4-storey wood frame buildings, this project can accelerate EV adoption across one of Calgary's largest housing construction cohorts."

## 6. Key Statistics to Emphasize

Include these in your application:

- **75,000-80,000 structures** built in Calgary during the 1990s
- **4-storey maximum** was the building code standard for wood frame construction until 2014
- **17% average energy savings** from individual metering (shows your building already promotes conservation)
- **33% of Calgary's GHG emissions** come from transportation (program's climate impact)
- **38% of Calgary's occupied dwellings** are multi-residential (size of the opportunity)
- **25 years old** in 2024 (typical aging building needing retrofit)

## 7. Competitive Advantages in Selection

The City will select a "diverse cohort" based on these criteria. Here's how you stack up:

| Selection Criteria | Your Building's Strength |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Building archetype | **Excellent** - Most common 1990s type (4-storey wood frame) |
| Building ownership | [Specify - condo/apartment] |
| Building age | **Excellent** - 1990s construction cohort (large segment) |
| Building location | **Good** - Inner-city Parkdale (geographic diversity) |
| Building size | [Specify units/stalls] |
| Parking configurations | [Specify - but typical for era] |
| Installation cost considerations | **Good** - Typical for building type (learnings applicable) |
| Charging cost considerations | **Excellent** - Individual metering simplifies allocation |
| Number/percentage of chargers | [Depends on your proposal] |

## 8. What Makes Your Building Stand Out

### For the City's Pilot Program Goals:

**Maximizing Learnings:**
- Your building type is highly replicable
- Challenges you face will be common across thousands of buildings
- Solutions can be standardized and scaled

**Informing Future Policies:**
- Demonstrates retrofit requirements for 1990s-era buildings
- Shows how individual metering facilitates EV charging adoption
- Provides cost benchmarks for similar building types

**Case Study Value:**
- "How to retrofit Calgary's 1990s 4-storey wood frame multi-residential buildings for EV charging"
- Template that can be replicated across a substantial portion of Calgary's housing stock
- Shows how aging inner-city neighbourhoods can support climate goals

## Summary

Your building is **not unique** - and that's exactly what makes it valuable to the ChargeYYC pilot program. By representing a common building type from a major construction era, your project can create a scalable template for EV infrastructure deployment across thousands of similar Calgary properties.

The combination of:
- Standard 4-storey wood frame construction
- 1990s construction era (large cohort)
- Individual electrical metering (key advantage)
- 25 years of age (typical retrofit candidate)
- Inner-city location (geographic diversity)

...positions your building as an ideal learning opportunity for the City to develop policies and best practices that can be widely applied across Calgary's existing multi-residential housing stock.
