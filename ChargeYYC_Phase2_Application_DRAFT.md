## SECTION 9: WHY YOUR BUILDING IS A GOOD FIT FOR ChargeYYC

### Building Representativeness

**How common is your building type in Calgary?**

Our 4-storey wood frame building constructed in 1999 represents one of the most common multi-residential building archetypes in Calgary. The 1990s saw substantial growth in Calgary with approximately 75,000-80,000 structures built during that decade.

Four-storey wood frame construction was the maximum height allowed under Calgary's building code at the time, making this the standard for multi-residential development in the 1990s. Code changes in 2014 permitted 5-6 storey wood frame buildings, but our building represents the pre-2014 standard that makes up a significant portion of Calgary's housing stock.

**How will learnings from your project benefit other buildings?**

Success at our property will provide a replicable roadmap for thousands of 4-storey wood frame multi-residential buildings constructed in Calgary during the 1990s-2000s. The electrical infrastructure requirements, upgrade pathways, and installation solutions we identify will be directly applicable to similar buildings from this construction era.

Our project will establish:
- Cost benchmarks for similar building types
- Technical solutions for 1990s-era electrical infrastructure challenges
- Process documentation from board approval through ENMAX coordination to installation
- Best practices for integrating EV charging with existing unit heating/hot water loads
- V2B capability implementation approaches for multi-residential settings

### Unique Features or Advantages

**What makes your building particularly well-suited for this project?**

1. **Individual Electrical Metering:** Each unit has separate electrical meters for heating, hot water, and electrical usage. This existing infrastructure makes EV charging cost allocation straightforward and fair - EV owners pay for their own charging costs through their existing electrical accounts, removing a common barrier to EV infrastructure approval in multi-residential buildings. Research shows individually metered residences consume 17% less energy on average, demonstrating our building already promotes conservation.

2. **Optimal Parking Layout:** Our single-level heated underground parkade is arranged in a horseshoe configuration around the electrical room, providing relatively short conduit runs from service to parking stalls. This efficient layout is typical of 1990s 4-storey construction and will demonstrate cost-effective installation strategies. The enclosed, climate-controlled environment provides year-round EV charging reliability in Calgary's winter climate.

3. **Strong Documented Demand:** With 36% of units already indicating EV ownership or near-term purchase plans, we demonstrate substantial, urgent demand that exceeds typical adoption rates. This isn't speculative infrastructure - it's responding to demonstrated resident need.

4. **V2B Innovation Leadership:** Few multi-residential buildings in Calgary currently incorporate Vehicle-to-Building capability. Our pioneering implementation will provide valuable learnings for City policies regarding V2B in multi-residential settings, including safety standards, metering considerations, and grid integration requirements.

5. **Community Buy-In:** Our AGM resolution demonstrates successful community engagement and consensus-building, providing a model for other condominium corporations considering similar projects.

### Geographic and Community Context

**Neighbourhood:** Parkdale - an established inner-city community

**Community characteristics:**

Located in Parkdale, an established inner-city neighbourhood that has evolved from primarily single-family homes (developed post-WWII in 1940s-1950s) to include multi-residential properties. Our building represents Calgary's urban intensification pattern and the evolution of older neighbourhoods toward higher-density housing.

This inner-city location presents different infrastructure challenges than new suburban developments, making our project valuable for understanding how to retrofit established neighbourhoods with EV charging capability.

### Scalability and Replicability

**How scalable is your approach?**

Our project offers exceptional scalability:

**Building Type Scale:**
- Template for thousands of 4-storey wood frame buildings from 1990s-2000s era
- Common construction method applicable across similar properties
- Typical electrical infrastructure challenges faced by buildings from this era

**Individual Metering Advantage:**
- Demonstrates how existing individual metering can facilitate EV charging
- Alberta requires suite metering for new construction - our approach shows how this infrastructure advantage can be leveraged
- Cost allocation model replicable to other individually-metered buildings

**V2B Pathfinding:**
- Pioneer policies for bidirectional charging in multi-residential buildings
- Safety standards and best practices development
- Grid integration approaches for distributed energy storage

**Process Replication:**
- Board approval and community consensus-building
- ENMAX coordination and utility upgrade navigation
- Permitting and regulatory compliance pathway
- Contractor selection and project management

### Climate Impact

**How does your project support Calgary's climate goals?**

**Direct Transportation Emissions Reduction:**
Enabling 10+ residents (36% of units) to transition to electric vehicles directly addresses the 33% of Calgary's GHG emissions that come from transportation, aligned with Calgary's Climate Strategy.

**Multi-Residential Climate Equity:**
38% of Calgary's occupied dwellings are multi-residential. Without programs like ChargeYYC, residents in these buildings face significant barriers to EV adoption compared to single-family homeowners, creating transportation inequity. Our project removes this barrier.

**Climate Resilience Enhancement:**
Vehicle-to-Building capability adds energy resilience, allowing the building to better withstand climate-related power disruptions while supporting grid stability during extreme weather events. This is climate adaptation, not just mitigation.

**Existing Building Retrofit Model:**
Preparing this 25-year-old building for next-generation transportation demonstrates how existing housing stock can be retrofitted for climate action, showing that older buildings can be part of Calgary's climate solution rather than obstacles.

**Multiplier Effect:**
By creating a successful, replicable template for 1990s-era buildings, this project can accelerate EV infrastructure deployment across thousands of similar properties, multiplying climate impact far beyond our single building.

**Grid Modernization:**
V2B-ready infrastructure positions our building to participate in future smart grid initiatives, supporting Calgary's transition to a more resilient and flexible electrical system that can integrate renewable energy sources.

**Long-Term Vision:**
Making sustainable transportation accessible to current residents while ensuring the building remains viable and attractive for future generations who will expect EV charging as standard infrastructure.

## SECTION 14: ADDITIONAL COMMENTS (Optional)

**Is there anything else you would like the selection committee to know about your project?**

Our building represents an ideal convergence of factors that make this project exceptionally valuable for the ChargeYYC pilot program:

**Representative + Scalable:**
As one of thousands of 4-storey wood frame buildings from Calgary's 1990s construction boom (75,000-80,000 structures), success at our property creates a template directly applicable to a massive segment of Calgary's housing stock.

**Demonstrated Demand:**
With 36% of units indicating EV ownership or near-term purchase plans, we're not building speculative infrastructure - we're responding to urgent, documented resident need that far exceeds typical adoption rates.

**Innovation + Resilience:**
Our Vehicle-to-Building capability positions this project beyond basic EV charging into comprehensive energy resilience and grid integration, demonstrating how multi-residential buildings can contribute to Calgary's climate strategy while enhancing community resilience against power disruptions.

**Infrastructure Advantages:**
Individual electrical metering removes a common barrier (cost allocation), while our optimal parking layout around the electrical room enables cost-effective installation that other buildings can replicate.

**Community Leadership:**
Our AGM resolution and strong resident support demonstrate successful community engagement, providing a governance model for other condominium corporations.

**Learning Value:**
This project will inform City policies on multiple fronts: 1990s building retrofits, individual metering advantages, V2B implementation in multi-residential settings, ENMAX coordination processes, and cost benchmarking for similar building types.

**Climate Equity:**
By demonstrating how existing multi-residential buildings can enable EV adoption, we address the transportation equity gap between single-family homeowners (who can easily install home charging) and the 38% of Calgarians in multi-residential buildings.

We're offering the ChargeYYC program not just an installation project, but a comprehensive learning laboratory that can accelerate EV infrastructure deployment across thousands of Calgary buildings while pioneering innovative approaches to energy resilience and grid integration.
