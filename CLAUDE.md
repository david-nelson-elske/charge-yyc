## Why Our Building is a Good Fit for ChargeYYC

Our building represents an ideal template for the ChargeYYC pilot program, with characteristics that are highly replicable across Calgary's existing multi-residential housing stock:

### Representative Building Archetype
- **4-storey wood frame construction (1999):** Our building represents the maximum height allowed under Calgary's building code at the time of construction. This archetype was the standard for multi-residential development in the 1990s, before code changes in 2014 permitted 5-6 storey wood frame buildings.
- **Part of Calgary's largest construction cohort:** The 1990s saw substantial growth in Calgary with approximately 75,000-80,000 structures built during that decade, making buildings from this era a significant portion of Calgary's housing stock.
- **Common construction method:** Wood frame with concrete foundation was the predominant construction method for mid-rise multi-residential buildings in this era, making our building typical of thousands of similar properties across Calgary.

### Individual Metering Advantage
- **Individual electrical meters and heating/hot water:** Each unit has separate utility metering, which is optimal for EV charging implementation. This configuration allows residents to pay for their own electricity usage rather than splitting costs across the building.
- **Energy conservation benefit:** Research shows that individually metered residences consume an average of 17% less energy, and submetering can reduce building energy consumption by 18-40%. This existing infrastructure makes EV charging cost allocation straightforward and fair.
- **Resident accountability:** Individual metering ensures EV owners pay for their own charging costs, removing a common barrier to EV infrastructure approval in multi-residential buildings.

### Strategic Location
- **Parkdale neighbourhood diversity:** Located in an established inner-city community that has evolved from primarily single-family homes (1940s-1950s) to include multi-residential properties, representing Calgary's urban intensification pattern.
- **Geographic diversity for pilot:** Contributing to program learnings from different areas of Calgary beyond newer suburban developments.

### Installation Complexity and Learning Opportunities
- **Typical 1990s electrical infrastructure:** Our building's 25-year-old electrical system presents the standard challenges faced by buildings from this construction era, including potential service capacity constraints and aging distribution panels.
- **Wood frame construction considerations:** Installing conduit and electrical infrastructure in wood frame buildings requires different approaches than concrete construction, presenting common challenges that many similar buildings will face.
- **Optimal parking layout:** Our single-level heated underground parkade is arranged in a horseshoe configuration around the electrical room, providing relatively short conduit runs from the service to parking stalls. This efficient layout is typical of 1990s 4-storey construction and will demonstrate cost-effective installation strategies for similar buildings.
- **Heated underground parkade advantages:** The enclosed, climate-controlled environment simplifies installation compared to outdoor surface parking and provides year-round EV charging reliability in Calgary's winter climate.
- **ENMAX coordination requirements:** Working with ENMAX to assess and potentially upgrade service capacity will demonstrate the utility coordination process for similar buildings across Calgary.
- **Balancing existing loads:** With individual unit heating and hot water already drawing significant electrical loads, we will demonstrate how to integrate EV charging through load management strategies (EVEMS) that other buildings can replicate.
- **Valuable troubleshooting documentation:** The installation challenges we encounter and solve will provide practical guidance for contractors and property managers tackling similar retrofits.

### Resident Demand and Community Support
- **Current EV ownership and demonstrated need:** One resident currently owns an EV and charges from the building's public electrical panel. This temporary solution demonstrates both existing demand and the limitations of our current infrastructure - the public panel cannot support the anticipated number of future EV chargers.
- **Strong near-term demand:** A resident survey indicates that approximately 10 EVs are anticipated in the near future, representing over one-third of our 28 units. This substantial demand demonstrates the urgent need for proper EV charging infrastructure.
- **Existing owner participation:** The current EV owner is willing to transition from the public panel to the new dedicated EV charging system, demonstrating resident commitment to a proper, scalable solution.
- **Demonstrated resident interest:** Completion of Phase 1 Road Map and passage of a general resolution at our November 4 Annual General Meeting indicate strong resident and board commitment to EV infrastructure and a forward-thinking approach to building improvements.
- **Barrier removal:** Currently, residents who own or want to purchase EVs face a significant barrier - lack of adequate home charging infrastructure. This project directly addresses this obstacle and enables the 10+ residents ready to transition to electric vehicles.
- **Future-proofing for new residents:** As EV adoption accelerates across Calgary, having charging infrastructure in place makes units more attractive to prospective buyers, protecting property values.
- **Community decision-making model:** As a condominium corporation, our project demonstrates how condo boards can achieve owner consensus and move forward with shared infrastructure investments that benefit all residents. Our AGM resolution shows successful community engagement and buy-in.
- **Enabling broader EV adoption:** Residents who currently can't own EVs due to charging limitations will be able to participate in the transition to clean transportation.

### Scalable Implementation Model
- **Template for similar buildings:** Success at our property will provide a replicable roadmap for the thousands of 4-storey wood frame multi-residential buildings constructed in Calgary during the 1990s-2000s.
- **Common electrical challenges:** The electrical infrastructure requirements and upgrade pathways we identify will be directly applicable to similar buildings from this construction era.
- **Documented learnings:** As part of the cohort, our experience will help inform City policies and provide practical guidance for other buildings with similar age, construction type, and metering configurations.
- **Cost benchmarking:** Our project will establish realistic cost expectations for similar buildings considering EV infrastructure, helping others plan and budget effectively.
- **Process documentation:** From board approval to ENMAX coordination to installation, we will demonstrate the complete implementation pathway for similar properties.
- **V2B innovation pathfinding:** By incorporating Vehicle-to-Building capability readiness, we will pioneer policies and best practices for bidirectional charging in multi-residential buildings, positioning Calgary as a leader in resilient, grid-integrated EV infrastructure.

### Community Climate Impact
- **Supporting Calgary's Climate Strategy:** Installing EV infrastructure will enable current and future residents to transition to electric vehicles, directly addressing the 33% of Calgary's GHG emissions that come from transportation.
- **Multi-residential climate equity:** 38% of Calgary's occupied dwellings are multi-residential. Without programs like ChargeYYC, residents in these buildings face significant barriers to EV adoption compared to single-family homeowners, creating transportation inequity.
- **Long-term infrastructure investment:** Preparing this 25-year-old building for the next generation of transportation demonstrates how existing housing stock can be retrofitted for climate action, showing that older buildings can be part of Calgary's climate solution.
- **Resident enablement:** Removing infrastructure barriers to EV adoption for residents who would otherwise be unable to charge at home, regardless of their environmental commitment or desire to reduce emissions.
- **Enhanced climate resilience:** Vehicle-to-Building capability adds a layer of energy resilience, allowing the building to better withstand climate-related power disruptions while supporting grid stability during extreme weather events.
- **Neighbourhood-level impact:** As one of the early EV-enabled buildings in Parkdale, we will contribute to normalizing electric vehicle adoption in established inner-city neighbourhoods, creating visible climate action in the community.
- **Multiplier effect:** By creating a successful template for 1990s-era buildings, this project can accelerate EV infrastructure deployment across thousands of similar properties, multiplying the climate impact far beyond our single building.
- **Grid modernization contribution:** V2B-ready infrastructure positions our building to participate in future smart grid initiatives, supporting Calgary's transition to a more resilient and flexible electrical system.
- **Intergenerational benefit:** Making sustainable transportation accessible to current residents while ensuring the building remains viable and attractive for future generations who will expect EV charging as standard infrastructure.

By participating in ChargeYYC Phase 2, we will demonstrate how a highly representative building archetype can successfully implement EV charging infrastructure, providing valuable lessons that can be scaled across Calgary's substantial 1990s-era multi-residential housing stock.
