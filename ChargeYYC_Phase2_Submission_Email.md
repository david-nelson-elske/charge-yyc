---

Dear ChargeYYC Electric Mobility Team,

Please find attached our ChargeYYC Phase 2 application for Hemisphere on The Bow Condominium Corporation (3412 Parkdale Blvd. N.W.).

**Project Summary:**
- Phase 1 Project ID: CY2857 (Road Map completed July 17, 2025)
- Proposed: 10 EV Enabled stalls + 10 Level 2 charging stations
- Total ChargeYYC rebate requested: $28,960
- Strong demonstrated demand: 36% of units (10 of 28)

**Key Strengths:**

Our 4-storey wood frame building (1999) represents one of Calgary's most common multi-residential archetypes, providing high learning value and replicability for the thousands of similar buildings from the 1990s construction boom. The project features individual electrical metering (enabling cost-effective EV charging integration), V2B capability readiness, Alberta-based EVEMS solutions, and a fair cost allocation model with board-approved common infrastructure and individual owner participation.

**Attached Documents:**
1. Phase 2 Grant Proposal (detailed application)
2. Phase 1 Road Map (Project CY2857)
3. Contractor cost estimate
4. Resident survey results
5. AGM resolution (November 4, 2024)
6. ENMAX correspondence

We are ready to proceed immediately upon approval and commit to completing installation within 9 months.

Thank you for considering our application.

Best regards,
