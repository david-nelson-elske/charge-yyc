# ChargeYYC Phase 2 Application - Key Highlights

## Executive Summary

**Building:** 3412 Parkdale Blvd. N.W., Calgary
**Type:** 28-unit condominium, 4 storeys, wood frame (1999)
**Parking:** 40 stalls in single-level heated underground parkade
**Demand:** 1 current EV owner + 10 anticipated EVs (survey data) = ~39% of units

## What Makes This Application Stand Out

### 1. Highly Representative Building Type
- **4-storey wood frame construction (1999)** = The standard maximum under building codes until 2014
- **Part of 75,000-80,000 structures** built in Calgary during the 1990s boom
- Success here creates a **scalable template for thousands of similar buildings**

### 2. Strong, Documented Resident Demand
- **1 current EV owner** using inadequate public panel charging
- **10 EVs anticipated** in near future (resident survey data)
- **36% of units** will have EVs in near term
- **AGM resolution passed** (November 4, 2024) to proceed if funded
- Current EV owner committed to transitioning to new system

### 3. Individual Electrical Metering Advantage
- Each unit has separate electrical meter (heating, hot water, electrical)
- Removes major barrier: fair cost allocation already built-in
- Research shows 17-40% energy savings with individual metering
- EV owners pay for their own charging - no subsidy conflicts

### 4. Optimal Infrastructure for Installation
- **Horseshoe parking layout** around electrical room = short conduit runs
- **Single-level heated underground parkade** = simplified installation
- **Climate-controlled environment** = year-round charging reliability
- Typical 1990s design = learnings apply to similar buildings

### 5. INNOVATIVE FEATURE: Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) Capability

**This is the game-changer that sets your application apart.**

#### What is V2B?
System designed to enable bidirectional electricity flow between EVs and the building/individual units, allowing EVs to:
- Provide backup power during outages
- Support grid stability during peak demand
- Store and discharge electricity as needed

#### Why This Matters for ChargeYYC

**Climate Resilience:**
- Building can withstand power outages using EV batteries
- Critical during Calgary's winter storms and extreme weather
- Enhances community resilience beyond just transportation

**Grid Modernization:**
- Positions building to participate in future smart grid programs
- EVs become distributed energy storage assets
- Supports Calgary's electrical grid during peak demand

**Policy Leadership:**
- Few multi-residential buildings in Calgary have V2B readiness
- Provides learning opportunities for City policy development
- Demonstrates how individual metering + V2B can work together
- Pioneering safety standards, metering, and grid integration approaches

**Future-Proof Infrastructure:**
- Ready for emerging V2B-capable EV models
- Infrastructure investment pays dividends as technology matures
- Positions building as leader in energy resilience

### 6. Geographic and Community Diversity
- **Parkdale neighbourhood:** Inner-city established community
- Evolution from single-family (1940s) to multi-residential mix
- Represents urban intensification pattern
- Different challenges than new suburban developments

### 7. Complete Documentation Package
✓ Phase 1 Road Map completed (Project CY2857)
✓ Contractor estimate (Parkdale EV Infrastructure)
✓ Resident survey showing demand
✓ AGM resolution authorizing project
✓ Individual unit metering already in place
→ ENMAX coordination in progress

## Framing for Selection Committee

> "Our 1999 4-storey wood frame building represents one of the most common multi-residential building types in Calgary - part of the 75,000-80,000 structures built during the 1990s boom. With 36% of our units demonstrating EV demand, individual electrical metering removing cost allocation barriers, and innovative Vehicle-to-Building capability positioning us as a climate resilience leader, we offer ChargeYYC a comprehensive learning laboratory. Success at our property provides a scalable, replicable template that can accelerate EV infrastructure deployment across thousands of similar Calgary buildings, while pioneering policies for grid-integrated, resilient multi-residential EV charging."

## The V2B Differentiator - Deep Dive

### Why V2B is Your "X Factor"

Most ChargeYYC applications will focus on basic EV charging infrastructure. By incorporating V2B readiness, you're positioning your project as:

**Beyond Transportation:**
- Not just about car charging
- Building resilience and energy security
- Grid modernization and smart city infrastructure

- Safety standards for bidirectional charging in condos
- Metering and cost allocation for V2B
- Grid connection requirements and protocols
- Building code considerations
- Individual unit vs. common area power distribution
- Insurance and liability frameworks

**Future-Proof Investment:**
- Current EV models with V2B: Ford F-150 Lightning, Nissan Leaf, some Hyundai/Kia models
- Growing list as technology matures
- Your infrastructure ready from day one
- Demonstrates long-term thinking aligned with Calgary's climate strategy

**Media/Public Interest:**
- V2B is newsworthy - generates positive publicity for ChargeYYC program
- Demonstrates innovation leadership
- Attracts attention to program success stories
- Shows Calgary as forward-thinking city

## Final Recommendation

**Lead with your strengths in this order:**

1. **High replicability** - Template for 75,000-80,000 buildings
2. **Strong demand** - 36% of units, documented, urgent
3. **V2B innovation** - Pioneering climate resilience + grid integration
4. **Individual metering** - Barrier already removed
5. **Optimal infrastructure** - Cost-effective installation
6. **Community buy-in** - AGM resolution + survey

This positions you as:
- **Practical** (representative building type)
- **Needed** (documented demand)
- **Innovative** (V2B capability)
- **Ready** (infrastructure + community support)
- **Valuable** (learning + policy development + scalability)

You're not asking for a favor - you're offering the City an ideal pilot project that checks every box and adds innovation leadership.
